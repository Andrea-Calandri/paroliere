# Paroliere
Paroliere is a thrilling word search game that challenges your vocabulary and sharpens your mind. 
Set in a 4x4 grid of letters, your task is to form valid words (at least four letters) by connecting adjacent letters.
The longer the word, the more points you earn!

The score table is as follows (length -> score):

- 4 ->  1
- 5 ->  2
- 6 ->  3
- 7 ->  5
- 8 ->  8
- 9 ->  10
- 10 -> 12
- 11 -> 14
- 12 -> 16
- 13 -> 18
- 14 -> 20
- 15 -> 22
- 16 -> 24
